                        <li>🚀 At Visa, I currently lead the UI/UX efforts for a large-scale horizontal platform, where I own the frontend architecture and development of core systems like a form builder, renderer, shared component library and SDK, along with RBAC and IAM management. This work is built on modern technologies like React 18 and Next.js 14 with the app router, leveraging Visa’s internal design system to create consistent, scalable, and accessible interfaces.</li>
                        <li>I also helped with the transition of the VDCS UI to React 18 with functional components and Redux Toolkit, improving code maintainability and performance across 110+ UI screens. These improvements made the UI faster, easier to test, and more modular for future scalability.</li>
                        <li>🔧 My responsibilities extended beyond frontend leadership—I led the migration of VDCS batch jobs to Visa's internal Hadoop platform, cutting down on software licensing costs by reducing third-party dependencies. This migration aligned with internal modernization efforts and helped streamline data workflows.</li>
                        <li>I also contributed to system stability by enhancing alerting and monitoring for batch jobs. Earlier in my role as a full-stack engineer, I shipped high-impact features like DAF and ApplePay configurations and worked on accessibility enhancements that brought the platform in line with the latest WCAG standards.</li>

                        <li>🚀 As a solopreneur, I’ve built a suite of innovative tools and products that reflect my passion for automation, design, and performance. <b>AutoProject</b> is an AI-powered project management tool that streamlines everything from PRD generation to task creation and integrates directly with Linear.</li>
                        <li><b>TechFlix</b> curates and summarizes over 150 tech blogs and 15+ research papers using AI models and LM Studio Inference, delivering content through a smooth SvelteKit-powered interface. These tools were designed not only for utility but to create a frictionless experience that blends technical depth with design elegance.</li>
                        <li>🎨 I also created <b>AltCSS</b>, an offbeat, class-less CSS library that pushes the limits of CSS design and is available on NPM. It's built for minimalism and experimentation, ideal for developers who want clean design without writing extra markup.</li>
                        <li>My tool <b>PicToWebP</b>—a multithreaded Python and Rust-powered image converter—enables lightning-fast folder-wide conversions to WebP. It saves over 90% disk space and provides detailed reports, making it ideal for optimizing image-heavy websites or local storage. These tools reflect my ethos of building sleek, efficient, and developer-friendly utilities.</li>

                        <li>📚 Alongside my engineering career, I run <b>The Research Nest</b>, a Medium publication focused on STEM education and research. I grew it organically to ~1K followers and 7K+ average monthly views.</li>
                        <li>My thought leadership on LinkedIn has also been widely recognized. I was one of India’s original 20 <b>LinkedIn Top Voices</b> in 2020 and the youngest recipient that year. I’ve grown my audience to 53K+ followers and over 4M annual impressions—all organically, without clickbait or shady growth hacks.</li>
                        <li>📝 Previously, I led the Writing Program at <b>Qrius</b>, where I managed editorial operations for a 12M+ reader base. I collaborated with the research team to bring fresh and insightful content to a diverse and informed audience, focusing on quality and engagement.</li>
                        <li>Before that, as <b>Head of Content at Probe, NIT Trichy</b>, I built the team’s blog presence from the ground up. I started flagship series like Alumni Corner and Probe Interviews and expanded the brand’s presence on LinkedIn and Instagram. My leadership ensured consistency and quality across all written and marketing output.</li>
